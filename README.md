## 1. Installation & Setup

Download the latest release from the project's GitHub page and run the installer.

### Critical First Step: Configuring `appsettings.json`
To enable GitHub integration (for Gist syncing and cloud backups), you must perform this one-time setup.

1.  **Locate the Backend Folder:** Navigate to the following folder on your computer, replacing `[User]` with your Windows username.
    * `C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Programs\dev2ndbrain\resources\backend`

2.  **Create a GitHub OAuth App:**
    * Log in to GitHub and go to **Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps > New OAuth App**.
    * Use the following configuration:
        * **Application name:** `Dev2ndBrain Local`
        * **Homepage URL:** `http://localhost:5174`
        * **Authorization callback URL:** `http://localhost:5174/oauth/callback`

3.  **Generate a Client Secret** and copy both the **Client ID** and the new **Client Secret**.

4.  **Edit `appsettings.json`:** Open the `appsettings.json` file from the backend folder and replace its contents with the template below, pasting in your credentials.

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": { "LogLevel": { "Default": "Information", "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning" } },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
      "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=dev2ndbrain.db" },
      "GitHub": {
        "ClientId": "PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
        "ClientSecret": "PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
      },
      "FrontendOrigin": "http://localhost:5174",
      "Gemini": { "ApiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY_HERE" }
    }
    ```

5.  Save the file and restart the Dev2ndBrain application.

## 2. Quick Tour (Sample Data)
Want to see how the app works without creating content from scratch? The installer includes a sample data file that will populate the application with pre-made notes, projects, snippets, and flashcards.

### How to Import the Sample Data:
1.  Go to the **Settings** page.
2.  Find the **Database Management** section and click **Import Data**.
3.  Navigate to the application's installation directory (usually `C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Programs\dev2ndbrain`) and select the file named `dev2ndbrain_db_local.json`.
4.  Confirm the overwrite warning. The app will reload with the sample data.

### 3. The Dev2ndBrain Interface
* **Sidebar:** Your main navigation on the left to access all major pages.
* **Header:** Contains the global search bar and GitHub login status.
* **Command Palette:** Your power tool. Press `Ctrl+K` to open a search bar that can find anything and create new items on the fly.
* **Tab Bar:** Switch between main pages and any items you've opened in a new tab.

### 4. A Deep Dive into Each Page

#### Dashboard
Your mission control, featuring widgets for:
* **Flashcard Summary:** Cards currently due for review.
* **Recent Items:** Quick links to your most recently edited notes and projects.
* **Quick Actions:** Buttons to instantly create a new Note, Snippet, or Deck.

#### Notes
The core of your knowledge base.
* **Mastering Markdown:** The editor includes a toolbar for easy formatting. You can use standard Markdown for headings (`#`), lists (`-`), emphasis (`**bold**`), and more.
    * **To Add Images:** Use the standard syntax `![alt text](https://url.to/image.png)`. For size control, use an HTML `<img>` tag: `<img src="..." width="300">`.
* **Linking Notes:** Create a link to another note by typing `[[` and selecting a note. This is the foundation of the Graph View.
* **Note AI Assistant:** Click "Ask AI" to summarize text, find action items, or explain complex concepts in simpler terms.

#### Snippets
A searchable library for your code.
* **Running Code:** Test `React`, `HTML`, `JavaScript`, and `C#` snippets in a sandboxed environment directly from the app.
* **Snippet AI Assistant:** Ask the AI to explain what a snippet does, suggest refactoring improvements, or answer custom questions about the code.
* **Gist Sync:** Sync snippets to private GitHub Gists for cloud access.

#### Projects
A dedicated workspace to manage your projects from start to finish.
* **Overview Tab:** A showcase of the project's title, Markdown-enabled description, and prominent cards for the **Current Goal** and **Next Step**.
* **Features Tab:** A searchable list to track all work items (features, bugs, etc.) with their status and description.
* **Resources Tab:** A searchable table of linked materials. Notes and Snippets are **clickable links** that open in a new app tab.
* **History Tab:** A complete, time-stamped audit trail with powerful search and filtering capabilities.

#### Flashcards
Memorize anything using a powerful Spaced Repetition System (SRS).
* Create decks and cards manually or generate them automatically from your notes.
* During review, rate your confidence, and the app's algorithm will schedule the card's next appearance for optimal learning.
* Use the **AI Review** after a session to get feedback on your performance and improve your understanding.

#### Graph View
Visualize the connections between your notes.
* Use the tag tree to filter the graph and focus on specific areas of knowledge.
* Use the **Annotation Layer** to add shapes, text, and arrows, turning your graph into an infinite mind-mapping canvas.

#### Settings
* **Note Templates:** Create templates for frequently used note structures.
* **Database Management (Backup & Restore):**
    * **Export Data:** Creates a full backup of your database as a single JSON file. Store this file in a safe place.
    * **Import Data:** Restores your application from a backup file.
        > **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This is a destructive action. Importing a file will **completely erase all current data** in the application and replace it with the contents of the backup file. Please confirm the dialog box prompt before proceeding.


### 5. Web Clipper Extension
The Dev2ndBrain Chrome extension allows you to clip content from any webpage. Simply select text, right-click, and choose "Save to Dev2ndBrain" to automatically create a new, pre-formatted note.
